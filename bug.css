The CSS property `calc()` is used to perform calculations within CSS. However, it is important to ensure that the values involved in the calculation are valid and compatible. For instance, using `calc(100% - 50px)` is fine, but `calc(100% - 50rem)` might not work as expected across different viewport sizes, due to the differing units.  Another common issue is forgetting spaces around operators in `calc()` expressions, leading to parsing errors.  Furthermore, nesting `calc()` functions can sometimes lead to unexpected behavior.  The following example showcases such scenarios and the potential issues.
